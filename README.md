##  About Me

Hello, World! I'm Peter, a Software Engineer based in Florida. A bit about me, my career began in retail management and operations. However, coding eventually piqued my interest and led me to join a software engineering bootcamp. Soon after, I was working in the field and I‚Äôm now pursuing an M.S. in Electrical Engineering. 

My day-to-day responsibilities can vary widely. They include deploying full-stack applications, migrating databases, improving developer experiences, writing test cases, and integrating APIs. When I'm not coding, I'm collaborating with designers and stakeholders, presenting to staff, conducting code reviews, interviewing candidates, mentoring peers, and onboarding new team members. I've worked on a range of notable projects, from in-house billing services and vendor marketplaces to personalization platforms. My work spans mobile apps for a few hundred users to web apps that reach several million across the globe.

My most common tools include: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, React, Nest.js, Next.js, Solid.js, Jest, GraphQL, Node.js, Postgres, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, NumPy, Pandas, SciKit Learn, AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, Google Cloud, DataDog, New Relic, Docker, Linux, Make, Yocto, Buildroot, CodeClimate, SonarCloud, Optimizely, GitHub Actions & Spaces.

Beyond general software engineering, I occasionally explore areas like cryptography, game theory, embedded systems, machine learning and playing the saxophone.
