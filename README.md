As a Software Engineer, I build software. I work at a product studio designing bespoke solutions. 
Each project requires discussing the scope and goal of each solution, sharing tradeoffs between different implementations, 
establishing milestones, collaborating with designers, and deploying high-quality code. 
Ultimately, my role is to improve lives and impact companies through software.


A typical day involves deploying servers, migrating databases, integrating API's, testing components, building endpoints, 
and reading documentation. Common tools include JavaScript, React, Node, AWS, GraphQL, Postgres, SQL, MongoDB, Express, 
Docker, Git, HTML, CSS, and more. My experience includes web and native projects; government and commercial clients. 
When I'm not working on products, I'm leading teams, managing talent, and driving operations.


In my personal life, I'm always curious about mathematics, algorithms, machine learning, and electrical engineering. 
Current projects include building an image classifier with neural networks and a recommendation engine for matching similar users. 
When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm likely in front of a smaller computer I refer to as my phone. 
Pursuing a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering.
